# Contributing to Handsontable for Angular

Your contributions to this project are very welcome. If you want to fix a bug or propose a new feature, you can open a new Pull Request but first make sure it follows these general rules:

1. Sign this [Contributor License Agreement](https://goo.gl/forms/yuutGuN0RjsikVpM2) to allow us to publish your changes to the code.
2. Make your changes on a separate branch. This will speed up the merging process.
3. Always make the target of your pull request the `develop` branch, not `master`.
4. Please review our [coding style](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) for instructions on how to properly style the code.
5. Add a thorough description of all the changes.

Thank you for your commitment!
